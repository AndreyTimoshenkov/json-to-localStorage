This is a test task for Frontend Developer position.

Functionality includes (but is not limited to):

1. Uploading a JSON file on the first page.
2. Saving the data to the localStorage (each item as a separate object with project id as key).
3. Parsing the JSON file on the second page.
4. Editing the data and resubmitting it to localStorage again.

Components are looking great thanks to Taiga UI and their global styles.

To run the app locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository;
2. Run 'npm i';
3. Run 'npm run start' or 'ng serve';
4. Have fun!
